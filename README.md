The calc sine curve project is a Java project that scans user input, validates it, and uses it to select options from a menu, calculate a sine curve area, and draw the sine curve.


1 - Calculate the y value (vertical position) for a given x value (horizontal position, in radians) on a sine graph.

2 - Calculate the area of the sine graph roughly using between 1 and 500 rectangles. More rectangles is more accurate.

3 - Draw the sine curve with 1 to 500 rectangles for a visualization, using the DrawingPanel import from the text buildingjavaprograms.com to simplify Graphics.

0 - Exit the program.

Invalid values will be rejected and must be entered again.
